# rust-basics

Here are contained basic Rust projects, which main objective is just to train the basics of the language.
Each project is either:

- A standalone script (which executable can be created with `rustc`).
- A cargo crate, for those projects that are a little bit more complicated.

## Scripts

- Fahrenheit <-> Celsius temperature converter.
