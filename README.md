# rust-basics

Here are contained basic Rust projects, which main objective is just to train the basics of the language.
Each project is either:

- A standalone script (which executable can be created with `rustc`).
- A cargo crate, for those projects that are a little bit more complicated.

## Uploaded projects

Here are listed all projects that are uploaded in the repository.
They all link to the main file, that is either the script RS file for the scripts or the 'src/main.rs' file at the crates.

### Scripts

- [Temperature converter](./scripts/temperature_converter.rs)

### Crates

- [Number guessing game](./crates/guessing_game/src/main.rs)
